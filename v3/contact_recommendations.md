# Contact Method Recommendations

The current contact button on your site is a placeholder (`href="#"`). For a static site (HTML/Tailwind), here are the best options to turn this button into a functional tool.

## 1. Professional Booking (Recommended)

Since the CTA is "Réservez votre appel découverte" (Book your discovery call), the most professional approach is to link to a scheduling tool.

- **Tools**: [Calendly](https://calendly.com/), [TidyCal](https://tidycal.com/), or [Zcal](https://zcal.co/).
- **Pros**: No back-and-forth emails. Automatic time zone handling. Syncs with your calendar.
- **Implementation**: Link the button directly to your booking page.

## 2. Integrated Contact Form

A form allows you to ask a few questions (e.g., "What are your goals?") before the call.

- **Tools**: [Formspree](https://formspree.io/), [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/) (if hosting on Netlify), or [Basin](https://usebasin.com/).
- **Pros**: Professional, keeps users on your site.
- **Implementation**: I can add a dedicated contact form section below or in a modal.

## 3. WhatsApp Direct Link

Very effective for quick inquiries and building trust.

- **Pros**: Extremely high response rate. Personal touch.
- **Implementation**: Use a link like `https://wa.me/33603610450`.

## 4. Simple Email (`mailto:`)

The simplest method, but prone to spam and depends on the user's email client.

- **Pros**: Zero cost, instant.
- **Cons**: No data collection, can trigger spam bots.

### My Recommendation

For your activity (**Coach en Image**), I suggest a hybrid approach:

1.  **Primary CTA**: Link the button to a **Calendly** (or similar) page for the discovery call.
2.  **Secondary CTA**: Add a small **WhatsApp** icon/link for quick questions.

**Which option would you like to explore?** I can help you implement any of these.
